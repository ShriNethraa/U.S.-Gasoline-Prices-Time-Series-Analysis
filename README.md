# U.S.-Gasoline-Prices-Time-Series-Analysis

**Tools and Skills Used:** R Studio, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, Statistical Modeling

## Objective: 
To analyze the U.S. gasoline prices from 1993 to 2024, identify long-term trends and seasonality, 
and forecast future prices using time series analysis techniques in R Studio.

## Process:
**1. Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Cleaned and transformed the dataset into a structured 
time series format suitable for analysis.
**2. Stationarity Check:** Performed tests to check for stationarity in the time series data.
**3. ARIMA Modeling:** Utilized ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling for 
accurate forecasting of gasoline prices.
**4. Time Series Decomposition:** Decomposed the time series to identify and analyze seasonal 
patterns and trends.
**5. Statistical Analysis:** Applied various statistical modeling techniques to understand 
historical fluctuations in gasoline prices.

## Result: 
The analysis identified key trends and seasonal patterns in gasoline prices, providing a comprehensive 
understanding of historical fluctuations. The ARIMA model delivered accurate forecasts for future gasoline 
prices, helping to predict market trends effectively.
