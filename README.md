# U.S.-Gasoline-Prices-Time-Series-Analysis

**Tools and Skills Used:** R Studio, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, Statistical Modeling

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed monthly U.S. gasoline prices from 1993 to 2024, applying time series analysis techniques to identify long-term trends, seasonality, and to forecast future prices. 
Using R, I cleaned and transformed the data into a structured time series, checked for stationarity, and utilized ARIMA modeling for accurate forecasting. I also decomposed the time series to uncover seasonal patterns, enhancing insights into historical fluctuations in gasoline prices.
